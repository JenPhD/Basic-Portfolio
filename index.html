			<p>After 16 years in academia and related research institutes, I've developed new skills as a <em>full-stack developer</em>. I have a PhD in sociology. I have previous experience in higher education teaching sociology courses including social psychology, deviance and crime, and medical sociology, among others, and working in a research institute in conjunction with the department of public health developing hospital disaster preparedness and response plans. I have experience with qualitative and quantitative social scientific data coding and analysis. These experiences give me a <em>unique perspective in understanding the needs of customers and clients</em> in various sectors of society, including health care, criminal justice, the workplace, and the marketplace. Besides development, my hobbies and passions include politics and public policy, reading, trivia, and music. An interesting piece of trivia about me: John Pemberton, the pharmacist credited with inventing the original formula for Coca-Cola, is my great great grandfather.
